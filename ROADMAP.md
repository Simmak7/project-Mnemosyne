# Mnemosyne Roadmap

> *Building the future of private, AI-powered knowledge management*

This document outlines the vision and planned development for Mnemosyne. Our mission is to create the ultimate **private AI brain** — a tool that helps you capture, connect, and recall everything important while keeping your data 100% under your control.

---

## 🎯 Vision

**The Problem:** Our digital lives are scattered across dozens of apps, folders, and services. Finding that one note, that important screenshot, or remembering where you saved something becomes harder every day. And most "smart" tools want your data on their cloud.

**Our Solution:** Mnemosyne is your private AI assistant that:
- Lives entirely on YOUR machine
- Understands your notes, images, and documents
- Connects ideas you didn't know were related
- Answers questions about YOUR knowledge
- Never sends your data anywhere
